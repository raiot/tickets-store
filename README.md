# Ticket Store

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### IMPORTANT
You need to create an .env file and store a
`REACT_APP_API_TOKEN` to access the TMDB.

### Structure

The app runs with typescript and sass.

On a note, folder structure could be better but I didn't had time to fix that.

### TODO

Didn't had time to implement:
* Cache using local storage to avoid calls to the api
* Cache for filters
* Image placeholders for api load
* Some typescript types
* Some parts of the app can use more design

### COMMENTS
* Instead of opening a new section, when you click on a movie image the
movie information appears in an overlay.
